how to check internet using both cubit &amp; bloc

- Bloc(cubit) is a state (data) management

Bloc extends cubit , then where is the difference between them?
cubit is a apart of bloc, this means it uses the same functionalities as bloc, _**this is exremenly wrong!!!!**_, cubit is just the minimal version of Bloc, this means u can use cubit for small apps or functionalities simply because it sends _**functions**_ to get states but not _**streams**_ as bloc does.
